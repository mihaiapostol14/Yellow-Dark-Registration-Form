A clean, modern registration with a yellow-accented dark theme. This small front-end project demonstrates a responsive registration UI built using plain HTML, CSS and a touch of JavaScript for basic interaction and validation.

- Simple client-side validation for form inputs
- Easy to customize colors and layout

## Technologies Used

- HTML
  - Structure of the form (semantic markup, labels, inputs, buttons)
  - Accessibility-friendly form markup (labels, placeholders and ARIA where needed)
- CSS
  - Styling and theming (dark backgrounds with yellow accents)
  - Responsive layout using flexbox/grid and media queries
  - Visual states (hover, focus, active) and subtle transitions
- JavaScript
  - Small scripts for client-side validation and form interactivity
  - Input handling (e.g., preventing submission if fields are invalid)
  - Optional UI touches (show/hide password, submit animations)

## Installation

Open a terminal and run the following commands to clone the project and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mihaiapostol14/Yellow-Dark-Registration-Form.git
cd Yellow-Dark-Registration-Form
```

After cloning, open index.html in your browser or serve the folder with a static server (live-server, http-server, or similar) for a better development experience.

## Usage

- Open index.html in any modern browser.
- Enter an email/username and password to test validation behavior.
- Customize the colors in the main CSS file (e.g., variables or root color declarations) to change the theme.

## File Structure (example)
- index.html — main page with the registration form
- css/
  - styles.css — theme and layout styles
- js/
  - main.js — small scripts for validation and interactions
- assets/
  - images, icons, fonts (optional)

## Customization Tips
- Colors: adjust CSS variables (if present) or change the color declarations to tune yellow/dark tones.
- Typography: add Google Fonts or local font files and update the CSS.
- Validation: extend JavaScript to integrate with an authentication API or to provide more robust client-side checks.
